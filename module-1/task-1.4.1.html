<h1>1.4 - 15/10/2020</h1>

<p>Today we worked more with VS code and Github, including adding new folders and files.</p>
 
<p>Additionally, we explored adding new branches and then merging them with the main branch. We also changed the theme of our mini website and viewed it live for the first time!</p>

<p>I faced a few obstacles, such as adding a new folder instead of a file, but overcame them in time to catch up with the rest of the class.</p>
